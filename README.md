# SI_Project
This project was for the Summer Internship (2 months), that we have to do after second semester. I was working in a team of 4. Other 3 contributors are @anishjain94 , @kapiltailor8266 ,and girish. 
This was for learning vue.js and node.js and also single page application.
The whole projects works like a single page application divided into components that can load dynamically.
The project is about showing covid19 figures in india through visualisation, so it is was to track the growth/withering of covid19 cases in india.
We have used external libraris for charts and tables(vue-chart.js and vue-table-dynamic).

Requirements- Node.js to be installed
              MongoDb localhost server to be installed.

Note: The localhost server is running on 3000
      Change mongodb localhost url to yours.


Download the folder
Open the terminal
  cd server
  npm run dev
Open another terminal
  cd client
  npm run dev
 
It should work fine.!
Feel free to share your thoughts. All the suggesstions are welcomed.
